# Missile Simulator

This program is a playground for simple missile simulations. Currently, only a balistic missile and a kinematics simulator are implemented. Future plans include cruise missiles and many types of interceptor missiles. 

## Setup
You can install dependancies either with pipenv (preferred) or with venv. Requires python 3.10.x or greater. 

### Pipenv

First, install dependencies with
`python3 -m pipenv install`
Next, enter the virtual environment
`python3 -m pipenv shell`

### Venv/pip

Create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv env`
Enter the virtual environment (may be different if not using bash)
`source env/bin/activate`
Then, install dependencies
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Using the Simulator

To run the simulator, do
`python3 -m sim.main`

A basic simulation includes a missile and a target. First import all necessary components
```
from sim.entities import Target
from sim.entities.missile.models import SimpleBalistic
from sim.simulation import Simulation
from sim.util.vector import Vector3
```
Then, create a target. Here, `Vector3(1000, 1000, 0)` is the target's position. This is an entity that is used to draw the target location on the screen.
```
target = Target(Vector3(1000, 1000, 0))
```
Next, create a balistic missile with a burn time of three seconds, the initial position set to `Vector3(0, 0, 1)`, and the target entity's position as its target.
```
bal_missile = SimpleBalistic(Vector3(0, 0, 1), target.pos, 3)
```
After creating all the entities, we can now create and run the simulation.
```
simulation = Simulation([
	target, bal_missile
])
simulation.run()
```
After some processing, the simulation has run, but nothing has been displayed or output. The simulation frames have been saved in memory and still need to be rendered. This is accomplished by calling `simulation.show()` or `simulation.save(path)`. The `show()` call will render and display the simulation in a GUI that supports repositioning the camera. The `save(path)` call simply renders the simulation and saves the video to the provided file path. 
```
simulation.save('output.gif')
```
Saving the simulation can take a long time and may require you to install `ffmpeg` and/or `H.264` through your system's package manager. For this reason, it is always a good idea to prototype/debug using `show()` calls, and then saving once everything is working.
